      The Ferrari SF90 Stradale is an impressive hybrid
      supercar that combines a 4.0-liter V8 engine with
      three electric motors, delivering a mind-boggling
      total power output of 986 horsepower. With its
      advanced hybrid system, the SF90 Stradale can reach a
      top speed of 211 mph, making it one of the fastest
      road-legal Ferraris ever produced. The car features an
      intelligent all-wheel drive system that maximizes
      traction and handling, providing exceptional driving
      dynamics. Accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in just 2.5
      seconds, the SF90 Stradale showcases remarkable
      acceleration capabilities. Its aerodynamic design,
      including active aerodynamic elements, ensures optimal
      downforce and stability at high speeds. With an
      electric-only range of 16 miles, the SF90 Stradale
      also offers the option of silent and emission-free
      driving in urban areas.
